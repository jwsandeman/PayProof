## The Problem

The app will be called Pay Proof and will be connecting tradies to homeowners in an attempt to bring payment guarantees to the domestic trade industry. This will enable peace of mind for the tradie knowing that before they start the job the customer has the money to pay for the job and the customer will have the ability to release the money once they are satisfied with the job that has been successfully completed.

This is a huge problem in the domestic trade industry as time and time again tradies are contracted to complete work on a home-owners residence only to have the homeowner take months to pay the invoice or in some cases not pay at all. This causes a lot of frustration and lost time when a tradie continuously has to chase down customers that aren't paying their bills.

This is a problem that can easily be solved with a digital application that checks a customer's funds before the job starts and then releases the funds once the job is completed and the customer is happy. This opens up a direct line of recorded communication between the tradie and homeowner and allows for issues and problems to be sorted out before progressing to the next stage/completion of the job.
